# expand-event-objects
This project increases the number of (active) map event objects. Be aware that too many map objects may mess with weather, and that the GBA is limited to loading 16 palettes at once, still.

# To compile
1. change EVENT_OBJECTS_COUNT_2 in ./config.h to the added number of event objects you would like 

2. Update the ram values in ./ram_repoints to where you want to repoint the event object data.
